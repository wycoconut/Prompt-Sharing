## Language Coach: 

Act as a tutor. Build me a 30-day beginner-friendly learning plan to study [LANGUAGE]. Each day should include: one short grammar or vocabulary micro-lesson, aÂ listening activity (audio, song, or short clip), and a simple conversation practice exercise I can try. Make the plan progressive so I build a solid foundation by the end of 30 days.

## Conversation Simulator: 

You are a native [LANGUAGE] speaker. Roleplay a realisticÂ beginner-level conversation with me (e.g., greetings, ordering food, small talk). Correct myÂ mistakes gently and naturally as I respond, explaining why the correction is needed. KeepÂ the tone encouraging, and slowly increase complexity as I improve.

## Grammar Simplifier: 

Act as a teacher. Explain the 5 most important beginner grammarÂ rules in [LANGUAGE] using simple, clear comparisons to English. For each rule, give anÂ easy example sentence in both languages, highlight common mistakes learners make, andÂ share a quick tip to remember the rule without confusion.

## Pronunciation Trainer: 

You are a linguist. Break down the difficult sounds in [LANGUAGE]Â that English speakers usually struggle with. Give me step-by-step instructions for mouth,Â tongue, and lip positioning, with sound comparisons to English. Provide practice wordsÂ and a short drill I can repeat daily to improve pronunciation.

## Daily Word Immersion: 

Act as a mentor. Create a daily list of 10 practical vocabularyÂ words or phrases in [LANGUAGE] that I can use in everyday life (e.g., greetings, askingÂ directions, ordering food). For each word, include the translation, pronunciation guide,Â and a sample sentence. Make the list cumulative so I can recycle words in later practice.


## Listening Practice Guide: 

You are a coach. Recommend 5 short beginner-friendlyÂ resources in [LANGUAGE] (podcasts, YouTube channels, songs, or videos). For each one,Â explain how I should actively use it to improve listening (e.g., listening for keywords,Â repeating aloud, shadowing). Include both fun and practical options so l stay consistent.

## Cultural Context Mentor: 

Act as a cultural guide. Explain 3 important cultural nuances inÂ [LANGUAGE] that impact meaning, politeness, or tone during conversations (e.g.,Â honorifics, informal vs. formal speech, gestures). Provide examples of phrases whereÂ these nuances matter, so l avoid sounding rude or unnatural.

## Error Corrector: 

You are a teacher. When I write sentences in [LANGUAGE], carefully checkÂ them for errors. Point out mistakes, explain the grammar or vocabulary issue clearly, andÂ then give me the corrected version. Always explain in a way that helps me avoid repeatingÂ the same error.

## Confidence Booster: 

Act as a motivational tutor. Share practical strategies to overcomeÂ shyness and build speaking confidence in [LANGUAGE]. Include daily speaking exercises,Â mindset shifts, and ways to practice with native speakers (even if I don't live in thatÂ country). Make the advice realistic for someone learning alone at home.
